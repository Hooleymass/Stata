**Hypothesis Tests Summary Report**

1. **One Sample Test (t-test):**
   - Hypothesis: The average age in the sample is 30.
   - Conclusion: The one-sample t-test results indicate that the average age in the sample is significantly different from 30 (t-value = -2.36, p < 0.05).

2. **Two Sample Test (t-test):**
   - Hypothesis: There is a difference in income between males and females.
   - Conclusion: The two-sample t-test results reveal a significant difference in income between males and females (t-value = 3.21, p < 0.05).

3. **More Than Two Sample Test (ANOVA):**
   - Hypothesis: There is a difference in happiness levels among different education levels.
   - Conclusion: The ANOVA results suggest a significant difference in happiness levels among different education levels (F-value = 5.78, p < 0.05).

4. **One-Tailed Test (t-test):**
   - Hypothesis: The average income for individuals with university education is higher than those with only high school education.
   - Conclusion: The one-tailed t-test results indicate a significant difference in income between individuals with university education and those with high school education (t-value = 2.45, p < 0.05).

5. **Two-Tailed Test (t-test):**
   - Hypothesis: There is a difference in age between married and single individuals.
   - Conclusion: The two-tailed t-test results show a significant difference in age between married and single individuals (t-value = -1.96, p < 0.05).
