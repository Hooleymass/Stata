To conduct hypothesis tests for the key variables chosen, we can use various statistical tests depending on the nature of the comparison and the research questions. Here are examples of hypothesis tests for each scenario:

1. One Sample Test:
   - Example: Test whether the mean age in our dataset is significantly different from a certain population mean (e.g., national average age).
   - Hypotheses:
     - Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean age in the dataset is equal to the population mean.
     - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean age in the dataset is not equal to the population mean.
   - Statistical Test: One-sample t-test or one-sample z-test.

2. Two Sample Test:
   - Example: Compare the mean income between males and females in the dataset.
   - Hypotheses:
     - Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean income of males is equal to the mean income of females.
     - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean income of males is not equal to the mean income of females.
   - Statistical Test: Independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (for non-parametric data).

3. More Than Two Sample Test:
   - Example: Compare the happiness levels among individuals with different education levels (primary, high school, university).
   - Hypotheses:
     - Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean happiness levels are equal across all education groups.
     - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): At least one education group has a different mean happiness level.
   - Statistical Test: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test (for non-parametric data).

4. One-Tailed Test:
   - Example: Test whether individuals with higher education levels have higher average incomes than those with lower education levels.
   - Hypotheses:
     - Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean income of individuals with higher education levels is less than or equal to the mean income of individuals with lower education levels.
     - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean income of individuals with higher education levels is greater than the mean income of individuals with lower education levels.
   - Statistical Test: One-tailed independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test.

5. Two-Tailed Test:
   - Example: Test whether there is a significant difference in the mean age between married and unmarried individuals.
   - Hypotheses:
     - Null Hypothesis (H0): The mean age of married individuals is equal to the mean age of unmarried individuals.
     - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The mean age of married individuals is not equal to the mean age of unmarried individuals.
   - Statistical Test: Two-tailed independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test.

Sure, here are the Stata commands for conducting the hypothesis tests mentioned above:

1. One Sample Test (t-test):
```stata
ttest age == 30
```

2. Two Sample Test (t-test):
```stata
ttest inc, by(sex)
```

3. More Than Two Sample Test (ANOVA):
```stata
anova happiness educ
```

4. One-Tailed Test (t-test):
```stata
ttest inc, by(educ) one
```

5. Two-Tailed Test (t-test):
```stata
ttest age, by(maritial) tw
```
