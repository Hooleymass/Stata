Sure, let's select "income" as the dependent variable and "age", "education", "marital status", and "happiness level" as the independent variables. We will fit a linear regression equation to the data using Stata.

Here's how you can do it:

```stata
// Fit linear regression model
regress income age educ marital_status happiness_level
```

This command will estimate the coefficients for each independent variable in the regression equation and provide information on the overall fit of the model, including the R-squared value, which indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.
