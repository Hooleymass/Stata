To conduct regression diagnostics in Stata, we'll use various commands and tests to assess different aspects of the regression model. Here's how you can perform each diagnostic test and interpret the results:

1. Linearity Test:
   ```stata
   // Partial residual plot for linearity test
   prais income age educ marital_status happiness_level, partial
   ```

   Interpretation: Examine the partial residual plot to assess whether the relationship between the dependent variable (income) and each independent variable (age, education, marital status, happiness level) is linear. If the plot shows a random scatter of points around the zero line, it indicates linearity.

2. Normality Test:
   ```stata
   // Normality of residuals test
   estat normal
   ```

   Interpretation: Use the "estat normal" command to test the normality assumption of the residuals. If the p-value associated with the Shapiro-Wilk test is greater than 0.05, it suggests that the residuals are normally distributed.

3. Heteroskedasticity Test:
   ```stata
   // Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test for heteroskedasticity
   estat hettest
   ```

   Interpretation: The Breusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg test assesses whether the variance of the residuals is constant across observations. A significant p-value indicates the presence of heteroskedasticity.

4. Multicollinearity Test:
   ```stata
   // Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for multicollinearity
   estat vif
   ```

   Interpretation: Use the VIF values to assess multicollinearity among the independent variables. VIF values greater than 10 indicate potential multicollinearity issues.

5. Endogeneity Test:
   ```stata
   // Durbin-Wu-Hausman endogeneity test
   hausman
   ```

   Interpretation: The Hausman test evaluates whether there is endogeneity (correlation between the independent variables and the error term). A significant p-value suggests endogeneity.

6. Specification Test:
   ```stata
   // Ramsey RESET specification test
   estat ovtest
   ```

   Interpretation: The Ramsey RESET test assesses the correctness of the model specification. A significant p-value indicates potential misspecification.

After conducting each diagnostic test, carefully interpret the results and comment on whether any violations of the regression assumptions are observed and how they may affect the validity of the regression model. Additionally, consider potential remedies or adjustments to address any issues identified through the diagnostics.
