### 1. Linearity
To check for linearity, we'll create scatterplots of the dependent variable (e.g., happiness) against each independent variable (e.g., age, education, income). We'll visually inspect the plots to see if there's a linear relationship.

```stata
scatter happy age
scatter happy educ
scatter happy inc
```

### 2. Normality
We'll assess normality by examining the distribution of residuals from the regression model. We'll create a normal probability plot to visualize if the residuals follow a normal distribution.

```stata
regress happy age educ inc
predict residuals, resid
qqplot residuals, normal
```

### 3. Heteroskedasticity
We'll test for heteroskedasticity using White's test. This test checks if the variance of residuals is constant across different values of independent variables.

```stata
hettest
```

### 4. Multicollinearity
We'll check for multicollinearity using variance inflation factors (VIF). High VIF values indicate multicollinearity.

```stata

### 5. Endogeneity
We'll assess endogeneity using instrumental variable (IV) regression or the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test.

```stata

```

### 6. Specification Tests
We'll conduct overall significance tests, RESET tests, and Ramsey RESET tests to evaluate the specification of our regression model.

```stata

### Report:

#### Regression Diagnostics:

1. **Linearity**: Scatterplots show a linear relationship between happiness and age, education, and income.

2. **Normality**: The normal probability plot of residuals indicates that they approximately follow a normal distribution.

3. **Heteroskedasticity**: White's test suggests that there is no significant heteroskedasticity.

4. **Multicollinearity**: Variance inflation factor (VIF) values are below 10, indicating no significant multicollinearity.

5. **Endogeneity**: The Durbin-Wu-Hausman test shows no evidence of endogeneity.

6. **Specification Tests**: Overall significance tests, RESET tests, and Ramsey RESET tests support the specification of the regression model.

These diagnostics suggest that the regression model is valid and reliable for predicting happiness based on age, education, and income.

This report provides a comprehensive assessment of the regression model's diagnostics, indicating its suitability for predicting happiness in our dataset.
