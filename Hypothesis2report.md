The results of a linear regression equation can be used to predict the values of the dependent variable (Y) based on the values of the independent variables (X1, X2, X3, etc.). Once the regression model is estimated, the coefficients (slope parameters) obtained from the regression analysis represent the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

To predict the values of the dependent variable, you can use the following formula:

\[ \hat{Y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_kX_k \]

Where:
- \( \hat{Y} \) represents the predicted value of the dependent variable,
- \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept term,
- \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_k \) are the coefficients (slopes) corresponding to each independent variable,
- \( X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_k \) are the values of the independent variables.

Once you have estimated the coefficients, you can plug in the values of the independent variables into the equation to predict the corresponding value of the dependent variable. This allows you to forecast or estimate the outcome variable for new observations or scenarios based on the relationships observed in the data used to estimate the regression model.

In Stata, you can use the "predict" command after estimating the regression model to generate predicted values of the dependent variable for each observation in the dataset. These predicted values can then be used for various purposes, such as forecasting future outcomes, evaluating the impact of policy changes, or making business decisions based on the relationships captured by the regression model.
